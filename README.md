Hi there, I'm Marlon Gomes! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Systems Development Student, Bachelor of Business Administration, Junior Developer, based in GoiÃ¡s, Brazil!

â€¢ ðŸ”­ I'm currently looking for my first job in the technology field, even though I'm already a professional in the area autonomously;

â€¢ ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning some fundamentals of computer vision, machine learning, cloud virtualization, among others;

â€¢ ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Data Analysis, Linux Servers, VOIP Linux Systems, Front-End, Back-End and Sport Shooting (the last one is serious);

â€¢ ðŸ“« Get in touch as soon as possible: mrlon.mra@gmail.com or preferably Telegram;

â€¢ ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ðŸ¦† Duck Foot;

â€¢ âš¡ Fun fact: One of the functions of the duck foot format is to reduce the cost of swimming by maximizing propulsion and minimizing resistance. Nickname I got in college due to the shape of my flat feet. ðŸ˜„

â€¢ ðŸ“” I'm reading: The universe of programming - William Oliveira ðŸ“š
